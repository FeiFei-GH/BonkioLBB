Bonk Version 48:

2 Step Functions:
N is football
J is normal

J["globalStepVars"] = {
                    discs: M1j[8],
                    shakeVectorThisStep: M1j[18],
                    soundsThisStep: M1j[13],
                    capEvent: E3,
                    teamGoalEvent: E1,
                    inputState: M1j[0][0],
                    gameSettings: M1j[0][4],
                    swingCollideDestroyEvents: M1j[33],
                };
