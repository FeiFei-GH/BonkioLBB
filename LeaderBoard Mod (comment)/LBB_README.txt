LBB_DB.js

Script Metadata: This section defines the basic information of the user script, such as the script's name, applicable URLs, author, etc.

Creating Script Element: The code creates a new <script> element named LBB_DBJS to run specific JavaScript code on the page.

Importing Firebase Modules: Within the newly created script content, it imports several modules from Firebase, allowing the script to interact with a Firebase application and Firebase's Cloud Firestore database.

Defining the LBB_DB Class for Firebase Interaction: This class has the following functionalities:

Within its constructor, it initializes the Firebase application and sets up a reference to a Cloud Firestore database for this app.
The class also defines a method named getPlayerData that fetches data for a specified player from Firestore.
Instantiating and Using LBB_DB: At the end of the script, it creates an instance of the LBB_DB class and attaches it to the global window object. It then attempts to use the getPlayerData method to fetch data for a player named "Sky_Dream".
Adding the Script to the Page: Finally, it sets the LBB_DBJS script element as an ES6 module type and attaches it to the document's head for execution.

In summary, the primary purpose of this code is to inject a script on a specific webpage, allowing it to fetch data for a specified player from Firebase's Cloud Firestore database.





LBB_Injector.js

Metadata section: This part defines the basic information and settings of the script, such as the name, version, description, matching URL, etc.

Constant Definitions:

injectorName: The name of the injector.
errorMsg: The error message to display when the injector fails.
injector function: This function takes a src parameter (likely a piece of JavaScript code) and then modifies it.

It first searches for the original code snippet (orgCode).

It defines a new code snippet (newCode) which is meant to replace the original code snippet.

It uses the string replacement functionality to replace the original code snippet with the new code snippet.

It returns the modified code.
Actual Application of the Injector:

If window.bonkCodeInjectors doesn't exist, then create it (it's an array).

Push a function to this array, which tries to apply the injector function to the incoming code and handles potential errors.
Console log: Outputs a message that the injector has been loaded.
